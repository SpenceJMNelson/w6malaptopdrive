  <h2>What is the Back to School Bash?</h2>
  <p>With the 2020-2021 school year fast approaching, we want to make sure that ALL of our DC students are able to have the resources that they need to be successful. We will be providing students with backpacks that include a digital device, traditional school supplies, personal protective equipment, and some fun activities/surprises to add some back-to-school joy!</p>

  <h2>Why Backpacks?</h2>

  <p>SYC/Mutual Aid is putting together a backpack that is truly comprehensive, and, unlike many backpack programs, we are giving Black and Brown students access to the same supplies that their White counterparts will receive. Access to quality supplies will empower our students to excel in school without worrying about the basics. We are also providing opportunities for recreation and health by including a baseball glove/ball and jump rope.</p>

  <h2>Who is Serve Your City/Ward 6 Mutual Aid?</h2>
  <p>Serve Your City’s mission is to provide life-changing experiences and opportunities for under-resourced Washington, D.C. students. It aims to make sure Black and Brown students receive the same opportunities their White counterparts receive. When not faced with a global pandemic, SYC provides programs that include 1) tutoring and college preparatory workshops; 2) the only majority Black youth rowing crew in Washington, D.C.; 3) yoga developed for youth of color; 4) water sports, including swimming lessons, snorkeling, and SCUBA diving instruction; and 5) financial literacy and college preparatory workshops. Given the health emergency, SYC immediately shifted its focus to ensuring that its students and the communities they live in have the resources needed to weather the pandemic and combat the systems that created the crisis.</p>

  <p>In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, SYC co-created the DC Mutual Aid Network, which is the central and only mutual aid network in the city serving Wards 5, 6, 7, and 8; and is acting as the lead organizer for mutual aid in Ward 6. The DC Mutual Aid Network is a community-led effort to safely support community members hardest hit by the pandemic. The network is a  grassroots, trauma-informed response to the pandemic for the most vulnerable and under-resourced communities in Washington DC. Members of these communities are disproportionately African Americans, People of Color, and those who have recently immigrated to the United States, and bear the burden of systemic poverty, racism, and environmental injustice. The mutual aid network is providing life-saving supplies, food, and PPE.</p>

  <p>SYC was born as a response to rapid gentrification in Washington, D.C.’s communities. One of the outcomes of the city’s changing demographics has been increasing privatization of programs such as arts and athletics.  SYC's programming addresses both health and economic disparities. Over the past eight years, we have helped underserved students in grades 7 - 12 in D.C.'s Wards 5, 6, 7, and 8 experience sports they typically do not have access to; and now, the digital divide is making distance education similarly inaccessible to our Black and Brown students.  We know that racist policies have kept children of color from accessing these activities, and our work today, while no longer out on the water or on the yoga mat, seeks to address and repair disparities for all children. Our goal is to disrupt these systems by providing access to equipment and safe environments with trusted adults who provide high-quality education.</p>


  <h2>What is our impact?</h2>
  <p>The DC Mutual Aid Network is serving 2,000 community members per week by providing food, cleaning and personal hygiene supplies, and other household items.  In addition to SYC’s work providing urgently needed food to families, the program has matched students with mentors, provided students with devices and hotspots so they may access the internet and online instruction, and has produced a Black public health campaign to educate the community about COVID-19 in a culturally sensitive manner. The theme of this work is “We Keep Us Safe.”</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Onboarded 150 volunteers and is volunteer led and organized.</li>
    <li>Manages a request/needs hotline from 9:00am-7:00pm daily. This hotline receives 100 calls per week.</li>

We have printed and distributed over 10,000 fliers relaying crucial public health information to vulnerable populations through the We Keep Us Safe Public Health Campaign. Created by volunteer public health experts, these fliers help to keep vulnerable neighbors in Ward 6 safe by providing them with culturally appropriate resources on how to avoid COVID-19 and what to do if they contract COVID-19. We have also spoken with media partners (podcast, radio, print) to spread awareness.</li>
        <li>Established multiple “pod” locations throughout Ward-6, including one at Capitol Hill Arts Workshop (CHAW), which serves as a donation collection hub.</li>
